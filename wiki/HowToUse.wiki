This page describes how to use the [http://code.google.com/p/denonavpcontrol/ Denon AVP/AVR Control] plugin for the [http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_features.html SqueezeCenter].  Optionally the plugin provides a very rich user experience when combined with the native iTouch application, [http://penguinlovesmusic.de/ iPeng].
=Using the Plugin=
First you must install the plugin as described in the installation wiki page.  Secondly if using the [http://penguinlovesmusic.de/ iPeng] you must install that application on your iTouch device.

Once the plugin is installed it is fairly straight forward to use, and in many cases there is nothing that you need to be aware of during use. The application is completely transparent with the exception of the optional audio settings adjustments during playback.
