This page describes how to install and configure the DenonAvpControl plugin for the SqueezeCenter.
=Installing the Plugin=
To install the plugin you download the zip file from the Downloads page.  Unzip the file preserving the entire directory structure into the plugins directory of your SqueezeCenter server.  Restart the SqueezeCenter server for the plugin to be recognized.

To remove the plugin from the server uncheck the DenonAvpControl plugin from the list of Plugins in the SqueezeCenter web control.

See the SlimDevices website for more information on how to install plugins.

=Configuring the Plugin=
The DenonAvpControl plugin is completely configured from the SqueezeCenter Web GUI.  There is nothing to be done on the Squeezebox nor does the Squeezebox have any display associated with the plugin.

Once the plugin is installed and the SqueezeCenter has been restarted, you can configure the plugin for your Squeezebox.  Note that you can have as many instances of the plugin as you have Squeezeboxes.  The settings and control of the plugin are specific to each Squeezebox.  However it is suggested that you do not have any more than one Squeezebox control a given amplifier/AVR.  You could though have mulitple Denon amplifiers in your system, all controlled seperately by a different Squeezebox and DenonAvpControl plugin.

To configure the plugin:

  * Access the SqueezeCenter Web GUI.
  * Choose Settings and the player you wish to configure
  * From the pulldown menu choose "Denon AVP Control"

==Enabling the Plugin on the Squeezebox==
You can toggle the use of the plugin on/off without having to remove it from the SqueezeCenter.
